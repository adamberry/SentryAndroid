# Sentry Website
Sentry is a Bluetooth controlled lock system utilizing Bluetooth to trigger a linear actuator via a TI MSP430 micro-controller. This repository contains the Android code. Note that this code can be used to ping any Bluetooth paired device. It doesn't necessarily need to be used with the Bluetooth module listed or the code in the embedded systems repository.
